# 🔨 Breakstuff

Breakstuff is a "breakroom" simulation website.
Users can search for "breakrooms" to reserve for use (use in this case includes releasing stress by destroying everything!)

Users can also share their own breakrooms and upload photos / rooms for others to reserve. Room owners will be able to accept or reject reservation requests from other users.

This website is modelled on airbnb.
